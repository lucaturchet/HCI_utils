Note: To make the program work you need to transform the first row of the .csv file, i.e., the header: the strings reporesenting the 10 questions of the SUS need to be replaced with Q1, Q2, etc., as per the example: 
sus_input_data_multiple_comparisons_original.csv -> sus_input_data_multiple_comparisons.csv
